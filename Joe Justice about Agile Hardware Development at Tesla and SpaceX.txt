okay let's get started
um welcome to our agile hardware
development meetup where we have a
special guest today
joe justice is the founder of wikispeed
inventor of the x3 manufacturing method
you've probably seen videos of him on
tedx um
plus he he's operated agile at tesla in
2020 which
we're excited to hear more about later
on
he is also the president of the agile
business institute
and gives classes on agile hardware
development
i was very lucky to take the class in
december last year
and i learned a lot about how agile is
or how tesla has operated in an agile
manner
i was super excited to see how tesla
manages to go through development cycles
multiple times per day so they design
build test manufacture actual hardware
multiple times a day and joe can explain
how that works
plus another takeaway that i had in the
class was that
the tesla is not only as
successful because they're operated in
an agile manner but also because of elon
musk himself so maybe joe can give us
some insight into
the elon musk way of working of
operating
his mindset and how he understands his
role
furthermore um we're happy to
um q a
joe later on so he will talk about
um agile um the agile way at tesla for
about 20 to 30 minutes we think and then
we will go into the q a session
we're super excited to have joe here
tonight we will leave the stage to him
in a few minutes and a few seconds
thank you everyone for joining and have
a great evening
so joe this stage is all yours
my honor and privilege to be here
catherine it was wonderful to work with
you in the course even in a
beta version of the course last last
year wow thank you so much now to engage
with agile hardware meetup germany
for me this is actually my dream direct
collaboration with people passionate
about the topic worldwide and even based
in germany a worldwide engineering hub
so thank you it's my honor catherine and
christian thank you for your work
thanks for being here
you can see the thumbs up
is my audio coming through okay
yes it is oh
perfect perfect
it's morning here in honolulu so i will
have a sip of iced coffee from a tikki
cup
and if people are okay
i see great comments already um
i'll zoom in on a palm tree
and introduce
my mentors
i worked directly with bill gates
later i consulted to the leadership team
at amazon
and then
i joined tesla as a full-time employee
and operated the agile program there
and i i actually love that i i put
michael
from uh
from airbus no sorry from carried
volkswagen group
right alongside
when i was collaborating with volkswagen
volkswagen group moving towards hardware
agility
at that time
what i learned from
bill gates
is
every business problem
should be cut
into as many parallel executable work
streams as practical
bill would ask us as the team and help
us as the team cut every business
initiative
into hundreds
of parallel executable work streams that
did not have to wait on each other they
could finish and be tested at any time
this
allowed massively parallel execution
and a tremendous amount of speed at some
times bill gates was the wealthiest
person on planet earth and i think this
was why
bill was able to execute massively
concurrently as an as an object-oriented
thinker
then bezos restricted team size to small
teams in practice typically less than
six people
this allowed people to have a high level
of psychological safety
and personal presence at work here's
what i mean if you're in a team of three
people
it's easy to say
here's what i think we should do
and here's why i might be right
and here is why i might be wrong
what do you think
and with three people
in 15 minutes or less we can have a high
level of psychological safety and deep
personal expression conversation about a
topic that allows innovation the pace of
innovation was extremely fast when bezos
made a mandate for small sizes of teams
they were called two pizza teams never
have a meeting of any sort including any
team meeting where two pizzas couldn't
feed the entire group in practice that
meant less than five people hopefully
these are relatively small pizzas for
health reasons
then i went to work
for elon musk
and i have never seen a company
this fast
if you've ever listened to an audiobook
at double speed
there's a point where the audiobook
speed feels normal
and then if you accidentally play the
audio book the same one at single speed
it seems slow and strange
that's what life was like working in a
musk company
it felt normal
it felt fun
easy
normal incredibly fast
and then
walking into any other company in the
world since then
feels like slow motion
like being in the movie the matrix where
you could dodge bullets they seem to be
coming so slowly
i'm now on the board of advisors of
three companies
and it's easy
because problems look like they're
coming from miles and miles and
kilometers and kilometers away and you
have so much time to dodge them
in tesla the goal was to solve any
problem whatever the bottleneck is in 20
minutes or less
it was an extreme level of agility and
the entire organization was structured
to support that level of speed
previously tesla was famous for being
very tiring
people would
burn out and leave the company
i believe to a large point this has been
addressed and the situation is is
actually quite comfortable and loving
at this point i would like to thank
catrin again
the
book
scrum master which includes chapter 10
on agile hardware
which
to this date is still the most complete
writing on agile hardware
um
is now available in german on lean pub
um katrin
would you like to
say anything about your experience
taking the course and moving some of the
language contact content to to deutsch
of course
it was super i was super excited to help
you with the translation
and it was
very interesting to see
these many details on how
tesla's operated um i didn't expect to
see so much or get too much so much
insight into tesla in your class
plus we
were working in teams and we created our
own products in your class which was
pretty cool um everyone or each team
chose a product that we developed in an
agile way
and we were really excited to see that
happening on a hardware level
um pretty fast to be honest
it was my honor to collaborate with you
and all the students um who now have the
professional credential agile hardware
developer
the course as you helped me translate
and also dennis and um
and and michael
is 10 stops of the tesla factory
and i've just
modified it
well i mean it never ends uh
substantially
we have an aerial view of the tesla
factory and i originally constructed the
the course around what i did operating
the agile program at each of these 10
stops like stamping and dies and what
that has to do with suppliers
body assembly sprint review and
retrospective automated test maintenance
model
paint coatings plastics
new model development the model 3 the
model y now the cyber truck and the new
roadster
what i'd like to cover today
is
much newer and has been
iteratively added to the course
since uh
since last year actually just in the
last two weeks
so unfortunately
katrin
wasn't in the course when this was
created
so she may enjoy this
she heard about
digital self-management
which i actually believe is tesla's
strongest suit
the strongest value out of the company
then many of you have heard about how
elon musk leads by sleeping at the
bottleneck
elon musk works
100 hours a week
every day of the week all seven days
and what elon does is elon joins the
teams
he doesn't talk to the teams or manage
the teams he joins the teams whichever
is the bottleneck so he'll join in a mob
or ensemble development for programming
robots or drawing cad or working with a
supplier that's currently a constraint
whatever the bottleneck is of any type
financial
software
mechanics
suppliers
brute assembly whatever the issue elon
will join that team
and elon will work there
until that point is no longer the
bottleneck
and then elon will move on
now elon's been doing that for 20 years
now making elon radically
cross-functional i'm not sure if elon
musk is a genius i i'm not sure maybe
but elon musk puts in the time and the
sweat
in any area of the company to have a
radically
competent holistic view of operations
not by managing but by doing the work
and when elon gets tired elon rolls out
a sleeping bag at the bottleneck and
sleeps
and when elon wakes up elon continues
working that sleeping at the bottleneck
combined with the fact that elon takes
no salary i mean elon doesn't even own a
house anymore he just sleeps in a
sleeping bag in the factory wherever the
bottleneck is
is very inspiring to the workforce
and elon drinks the same coffee as
everyone else uses the same bathroom as
everyone else
parks in the same employed parking lot
as everyone else
it makes the organization feel very flat
now that combined with a mandate where
if anyone prevents you from talking to
anyone including elon musk they will be
fired immediately
that mandate keeps the company very flat
so you have a very flat company with an
owner who is paying you who makes less
money than you and sleeps in the factory
it's extremely exciting
this might be already a good time
to talk about sustainable pace
i don't think all of us need
to sleep in the factory in a sleeping
bag now it works it's very effective
but what if you want to be present
as a spouse or a parent
what if you want to have a side project
writing a book
what if you want to be involved in
sports or camping or caravanning
well
i've been spending
the last year creating
my lifestyle and recommendation on what
gets the maximum benefit of what i
learned
working for elon musk
with the the least amount of deviation
from a standard accepted global
lifestyle
and
here's my
learning so far
one hour or more a day
mobbing at the bottleneck
this means not talking to the people at
the bottleneck not having a meeting with
the people at the bottleneck but joining
ensemble development pair development or
mob development specifically i mean
exactly the way woody's will explains it
at the point of the bottleneck and that
is especially true if it's not your area
of expertise
by doing something like mob with a seven
minute rotation for example
you'll have seven minutes
where you are trying to do the work but
everyone else is helping you encouraging
you cheering you on answering your
questions in your real time
what that means is your rate of learning
is radically fast in an hour you'll have
a very different level of understanding
than any presentation could have given
you about the topic and if you're in a
leadership capability if your
organization is not 100 flat
you will have
a far superior context to make any
decision than you would any other way
if this is done one or more hours every
day
much of the value of sleeping at the
bottleneck
is
is
is given to you
the next value of sleeping at the
bottleneck is you have around the clock
development
you know when you wake up the problem
will be different than you go to sleep
that prevents solo ownership or working
alone you know someone else or many
other people are working while you sleep
and you will get a different
problem
when you wake up
the situation will be different
also it means if you fall asleep
thinking about the bottleneck
you have an opportunity for deep
learning while you sleep and often
you'll wake up with a different
understanding of the problem so that's
also beneficial
well how to get some of that benefit
another way
tweet length
journal
before sleep
read
on awakening
i did this when i was at tesla it helped
me a tremendous amount
just before going to sleep i would
journal at least a tweet length
sometimes pages but often a tweet length
so
very small
of what is the current problem as i
understand it
and the first thing i did when i woke up
is i would read that and then i would
get up and
go shower or whatnot
that seems to create more of the value
of around-the-clock development shared
ownership
and giving your sleeping mind an
opportunity to evolve the problem
digital self-management
is the concept where
anyone anywhere in the company can try
something new
and in seconds have feedback on if that
new thing is valuable to the company
that means they don't have to wait on a
management review
to
invest further in a topic
so how to get near digital
self-management
this was a massive
it project and continues to be so in all
the musk companies
so what i believe is
invest
in digital self-management
as a core product
of your company and this is what the
company means
now in in in this year
as web 3.0 begins really
your company is your digital
self-management stack
which truly means a software first
company
again the goal meaning
more and more types of operations get
rapid feedback were they good or not
good to the company in seconds and this
is truly what the musk companies are
awesome at doing
now related to this
are
agile supplier contracts
which if we have time we'll discuss in
more detail but i'll at least list it
here
and
silicon valley
budgeting
volkswagen
a month and a half ago
published their nine year financial plan
their nine year budget
how agile is that
if
money is earmarked at the large level
nine years in advance
that means any significant cash
investment which in volkswagen cases
more than three million euro
needs to go through the board of
advisors for approval
and they don't meet every day
so you have a lag time to request
significant amounts of budget more than
three million euro
and the criteria for that financial
release
is
will it triple its value within the next
few years usually three years if not
same year
well that prevents many types of
innovative problem solving
tesla does not have a budget
instead they do what's called silicon
valley budgeting
where everyone at any time real time on
their phone
can see how much money the company has
left
and they have an efficiency metric for
how efficient that money is being spent
and the goal as an employee of a musk
company is to spend money as fast as you
can efficiently
by having digital self-management on
efficiency
you have complete freedom to spend money
as fast as you possibly can on your own
and if your
your burn rate how fast you spend money
is red
that means it's below average efficiency
for the company
you were then encouraged to use the law
of two feet
to go join a project with higher
efficiency or increase another project's
efficiency
this is part of the digital
self-management and there's no budgeting
instead you have what's called silicon
valley accounting where you have runway
or your remaining money
and then you have burn rate or how fast
the money is being spent
and your one goal
is to spend money as fast as you
efficiently can
this is agile
when the chip shortage occurred in
automotive which is still affecting
automotive worldwide
volkswagen bmw
daimler
ford mitsubishi toyota all had reduced
outputs
the amount of vehicles they could
produce went down
tesla's amount of vehicles produced and
sold went up
because there was no budget in tesla
that had to be reverted that had to be
redirected to address the chip shortage
the same day people were spending money
on different chips and writing new
software for those chips and validation
systems
whereas in other companies there needed
to be a proposal an emergency coalition
a set of approvals a plan developed a
waterfall plan
of in phases how they would onboard and
substitute different chips
of course that's slow that's waterfall
we've known it was slow since 1910 when
gantt charts were published
so you have these concepts
working together
to create the musk model
what i'm trying to paint here is pink
practices being the musk model
and blue practices being
justice agile hardware
and what i hope
is that more and more companies do take
on the musk model
my dream is there'd be eight billion
companies
running at the speed of innovation as
the musk companies that's one company
for every human soon to be alive right
now there's around 7.2 billion humans
soon it'll be 8 billion and i hope they
all run their own company as an
individual contributor to society that's
innovating as fast
as the musk companies
now these blue cards
are how i'm attempting to run my own
business in life
and i hope
they're almost as valuable in terms of
pace of innovation and maybe even more
approachable
with that introduction i'd like to
switch our conversation to
conversational
with christian katrin and all of you
teaching me i'm definitely open to learn
what you know on these topics asking
questions if you want to and having an
open and collaborative conversation
by the way today
spacex has done what's called stack
starship so you have the largest rocket
ever made by humans
fully assembled on its launch tower and
today elon musk will be giving an update
on starship and when it will start
delivering
thousands of kilograms into orbit per
launch which is far and away the most
mass ever delivered into orbit by a
single rocket or even rocket series
so that's happening today to talk about
pace of innovation truly many things
that humans have never been capable of
before
to the purpose of spreading the light of
consciousness out among the stars
actually i'd
this one is super important
many people
feel
elon musk's
management is unpredictable
it's unpredictable
if you are attempting to maximize
investor return this year
the volkswagen group for example is one
of the coolest companies on planet earth
and herbert dyes is an extremely
talented agilist possibly more talented
than elon musk
but
large investments from volkswagen group
are made
on the basis of how will they return a
near-term profit to investors
the majority of whom is the pierce
family
mispronounced in many parts of the world
is the porsche family who have a 40
share in volkswagen group
if
your primary budgeting criteria is how
will we have a near-term return on
investment for
the pierce family and in aggregate all
shareholders that will lead you to make
different decisions
than if your investment is on a
thousand-year vision
every decision in the musk companies
is highly predictable
it's based on how do we spread the light
of consciousness out among the stars
so near term how do we have a fully
self-sustaining
human city on mars
so in the event of a catastrophe on
earth
civilization and the light of
consciousness continues
then so on and so on and so on out among
the stars
elon has taken no paycheck
in 20 years
all the money made is put directly back
into the companies to spread the light
of consciousness among the stars
now interestingly
that's made more money than every other
car company combined
so by prioritizing long-term roi
thousand-year return on investment
the most near-term investment has been
made
this makes elon's decisions highly
predictable
there's
the concept of electric vertical takeoff
aircraft
elon has said i'd love to make an
electric jet
i
but but i won't in the near term why
an electric jet or vertical takeoff and
landing electric vehicle is extremely
practical on planet earth
it's not practical on the moon or mars
different atmospheric conditions so if
the goal is to spread the light of
consciousness among the stars
vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or
electric aircraft is not critical path
it's not critical chain
diesel
ultra efficient diesel or internal
combustion of any type is not valuable
on the moon or mars or beyond
in the near solar system however solar
and nuclear is
many people seem confused why elon also
likes nuclear energy along with solar
well both are required for deep space
travel
so if you look at this thousand-year
vision
musk's decisions are actually extremely
predictable
this i think is a key difference in
leadership mentality and likely
important if you want to try to innovate
at the speed of the musk companies
okay okay now that that's laid out i
would love to make this conversation
much more collaborative i'll see if on
this
platform there i've stopped share so
other people can even turn on their
video if they like when we're conversing
thank you so much christian thank you so
much catherine it's already an honor to
be here let's have a collaborative
conversation
thank you very much joe can you hear me
well
i can and and i just see michaela schatz
is in the chat
yes he is
he commented
mike commented on him putting him
next to elon and jeff
deserved well deserved i it's it's my
honor to collaborate with period if only
the budgeting cycle allowed them to be
even more agile and maybe at some point
it will uh they're phenomenal
um if you're okay with the job we would
go to the first question um and if to
everyone else as well uh right next to
the chat you have the option
to um add questions or you have to you
can vote up the questions that are
already in the chat and we will go top
to bottom so basically the highly uh the
highest ranked uh question first
uh organ had the first question would
you mind explaining your question
sure
hi joe
um
actually how are the teams at spacex and
tesla organized i heard that there's no
real product teams like you would expect
in a traditional company like cyber
truck etc so people are organized around
problems or challenges not their own
products
exactly i love the question if you don't
mind keep your camera on for now so we
can
talk about it if we'd like to
um if any of you or if you yourself uh
you can
have attended agile lean europe or agile
testing days
those conferences are structured a lot
like how the musk companies are
structured
so when you attend
agility europe or agile testing days or
any open space conference there's an
agenda
and it says in this room there's no
topic from 8 am to 9 a.m no topic from 9
to 10 no topic from 10 to 11. so you can
propose a topic in this conference room
saying here's the empty time slots
and people propose even new locations so
by lunchtime at the conference there's
the west end of the hallway by the
bathrooms is like a new conference space
right people
create new spaces and they just add them
to the agenda
well what that means is anyone can
propose an agenda item say in in
conference room a
we want to talk about increasing heat
pump efficiency in the example of tesla
or we want to talk about um
uh
x-ray testing of our orbital welder in
the case of spacex so you have problem
statements or opportunity statements
and then
everyone is encouraged to use the law of
two feet
meaning take your use your own two feet
to go wherever you think you can be
contributing the most value
and you can change at any time so there
are no teams
there's an agenda
and you can add to the agenda
and if no one is on a problem it's auto
deleted it's gone
and you you choose
now what prevents people from making
something off mission from proposing an
agenda item that is not a critical path
which i tried to do many times i kept
proposing tesla racing i i was
co-captain of a race team at the
nurburgring at the norwich life uh
wikispeed.de i
love working with guido kramer on on
wikispeed de and i proposed many times
let's do tesla racing it was always
immediately killed immediately and i
would i you know i would use my law of
two feet and it was still killed so why
how
you have to propose
a
financial a measurement of value
and that measurement is totally
different depending on what your
opportunity
is
and it doesn't even mean it's the right
measure of value you at least have to
have one and then anyone can propose a
better one and if it's majority voted
it's replaced right so you organically
have hopefully a better and better fit
value measurement
well then these machine learning stacks
this is the part of digital
self-management
automatically
measure
a guess of how much it's costing your
team to execute
well your team your agenda item
to be executed and that's measured by
who's there
how much does it cost to employ them how
long were they there what robots were
you using what's a fraction of the cost
of the company of those robots how many
cubic meters of volume of the facilities
are you using how much electricity does
it look like you're using that's all
automated you don't have to fill in
anything and it's actually now pretty
accurate because the systems have been
running for 20 years so they're pretty
good now in the beginning i'm sure they
were awful but by the time i got there
they were actually really good and it's
totally automated there's no time sheets
nothing like that
so you get a value divided by expense
per agenda item
and for me racing
had extremely low value relative to the
other work i mean it actually has many
values many companies are able to
justify financially racing but compared
to the other opportunities tesla has
right now it was so small it was
immediately re kicked off of the agenda
no matter how many times i proposed it
no matter how good a value measurement
that i was able to think it just was was
so small and it was valuable but not
in comparison to the other topics so
that is the the team structure it's like
you said it's problems or opportunities
and who's on the team could switch by
the second in practice many people are
in the same group for years but they
could travel multiple times a day
yeah thank you for sharing those
insights john
thanks for the question organ
uh joe we would go to the next question
um with the second highest votes we
actually have a lot of questions that's
great and you can still add questions in
the q a sections to everyone
the next question comes from enis
let's see if she's
willing to hop on stage here
oh there she is
yeah hey
thanks for the question
uh yeah thanks for giving me the
opportunity to ask i guess
um yeah and uh thanks again for the uh
yeah i have to
switch the
monitor that i can see you um
yeah thanks again for the insight it was
really uh really interesting
and uh my question my first question
would be um
how uh does the digital staff management
looks like look like uh you gave us some
examples but could you just give us even
more impressions on how it works
absolutely yes absolutely now digital
self-management
has has a common
library of
software elements that that are
that are that are largely plug and play
you don't have to be a deeply skilled
programmer to to work with most of them
you need to be able to write script
and those continually evolve by anyone
who joins those agenda groups to improve
them
and by this point 20 years in many of
them are really good
then
each agenda item
needs to propose its own value right
so they then
end up creating their own
measuring stack their own digital
self-management stack by dragging and
dropping from the library maybe writing
some script
what that means is
digital self management looks very
different depending on where you are
in the facility often the people that
made it put pictures of themselves as
memes
so funny pictures of themselves in their
tool so for example there's a tool that
shows the flow rate of flow and where
the bottlenecks are in part of the paint
process
and instead of cars it's one of the
people who was there when that tool was
made it's their face and it dips in the
fluid and comes out and it's all visual
the the goal is
it looks like a game on your phone
it should be
if you can the goal is for it's
immediately understandable
it's funny
uh and you can view it on your phone
uh so depending on which area you're in
it's a different tool
and you can enhance the tool yourself um
they're made to be
you don't have to go into deep code in
order to make meaningful
adjustments
um many things you can like use sliders
and radio buttons
um to get real-time feedback on the
value the cost is this the bottleneck
um where is the bottleneck
and uh
the key piece is they do look different
all the time and they often look very
funny
and um usually they're very clear
usually they're immediately
understandable
many times there's a heat map involved
fundamental to
tesla's machine learning
investment is
vision
looking at a video feed or several video
feeds together and trying to make some
labels
what is there
and tesla's really good at that now
they're really good at saying what is in
these videos
and is it moving
then
basic decisions based on that and and i
mean basic we're definitely not at your
genius partner artificial intelligence
yet um but basic decisions like
should this robot move left or right
probably can make that decision pretty
well
um what's the safe move okay that is
really good because the first criteria
is safety
so what that means is you already have
machine learning stacks that are really
good at what's called auto labeling what
do i see
and have some concept of
should i do something
so you can have these heat maps
of
almost anything
if if a car or parts of a car or a group
of people
comes through
an agile space uh well it's all agile um
the definition of ready is what we call
it where things come in to any given
area the definition of ready
laptop cameras just ordinary cameras
bought from amazon or from a big box
store whatever's on sale with usb or
standard connections are taped
all around the factory it's very very
inexpensive
and
they'll see parts or people coming
through and they'll put a heat map on
judging do we think this was good or not
good
and good is more green and not good is
more red and purple has a special
meaning and what that means is through
these machine learning stacks this
digital self-management you can
immediately see is it trending
better whatever it is
so if you're trying to improve the
efficiency of heat pumps and heat pumps
are flowing in
part of your definition of ready is
what is the efficiency of these heat
pumps so there'd be a robotic automated
test and the goal is five seconds or
less so
the heat pump goes through what's its
efficiency and then your definition of
done is what's the heap up heat pump
efficiency now so your heat pump heat
map will show you more green if the
efficiency is improving from whatever
you're doing
and judging by your cost the machine
vision detects there's 11 people
swarming in here it knows your salaries
it's nothing creepy i mean everyone's
paid almost the same in tesla so that's
not weird anyway the primary income is
stock price
so it says i think it costs you this
much to be doing what you're doing
and heat the efficiency is one percent
greater
that's actually huge because that
translates directly into more range um
that translates directly into stock
price almost correctly i mean range is a
critical factor for ev
price and value of the company
so the dsm digital self-management will
tell you that
and it would probably have funny
pictures of whoever was in the team when
that stack was made ines did i did i
answer did i give you something
yeah yeah yes you did thank you very
much
and sure there's more questions coming
in the minute we speak
so the next one
we will also try to get him on stage
he would like to know complete example
of a problem that a mask team solves
within 20 minutes that got the most
votes in the last
two or three minutes i think
so it got voted up a lot
awesome awesome
uh gerhard would you like to join by
video yes thank you thank you very much
almost i did see your video for just a
moment
thank you
yeah would you like to say something or
we can't see or hear you right now
i did see you for just a moment you had
a wonderful video we could see the
question
uh okay um
i have all kinds of video and picture
and journal entries on exactly this
topic
many of these have not yet been said by
someone other than me
and i do have a non-disclosure agreement
at tesla so what that means is
i
am encouraged to talk freely about
anything that has already been disclosed
um some of the digital self-management
is already visible in videos tweeted by
elon musk
or by tesla china
um
many of these 20-minute
issues
i i'm trying to think which of them are
now public
okay here's one
here's one that's now public sandy
monroe
is um
now a world famous
uh automotive engineer and process
expert
manufacturing process expert and other
processes and sandy will buy
a new car from every car company porsche
the newest taken
tesla the newest model s whatever the
the car is and sandy and sandy's team
will take it apart on video
put it on youtube and they'll analyze
how this vehicle was produced and the
cost efficiency engineering efficiency
level of engineering etc
and
some of what i'll talk about now has
already been published on youtube not by
me but by sandy monroe
so it's in the public domain already
robotic assembly
of
cars
has trouble with flexible parts
like wires or tubes or hoses
it can work but it's much more
challenging it's far more efficient for
humans to handle flexible parts like
hoses
wires
flexible tubes
it's much higher value to have humans
doing creative problem solving and not
assembly
humans should always be involved in
assembly to ground their creative
problem solving so they're solving real
problems
so creative problem solving is always
intended to be done within three meters
of the machine
that's working on your step so if you do
embedded software programming for a chip
ideally you'd be within three meters of
the machine that puts that chip into the
car
so you're you're in context
of
the thing you're working on even if it's
software for example so you're there
you're in the point of assembly you're
typically sitting on the floor with a
laptop with a in a circle of other
people with laptops right by the machine
a problem that was solved in 20 minutes
or less
was
one of these wiring harnesses
many people needed to route the wiring
harness through different areas of the
car plug it in test the connections etc
all the wires were replaced with solid
aluminum rods
which from a cost standpoint does cost
more than some low-grade braided metals
which is what most car companies would
use
but by looking holistically at the
problem and not only the cost
of the part
actually aluminum as a raw material is
cheaper but you don't have vendors
already creating solid aluminum rod
wiring harnesses for you where there are
vendors already producing braided
flexible wiring harnesses for you
so you can just buy
spec harnesses on relatively short
startup costs with very low startup
costs whereas if you're making your own
rigid wiring harness out of solid
aluminum rod you have your startup cost
your your setup costs
but the eventual materials cost is
actually lower
so in the long run it is a better play
well the benefit of solid aluminum rod
wiring harnesses is
they don't flex very much
in fact depending on what
packaging you do they don't flex at all
and robots can install the wiring
harness
and
prototypes of that and then eventually
the final solution were absolutely put
in place in 20 minutes or less
another example that's been made public
by farzad
was
an outbound logistics system
so you're in
one of the warehouses connected to one
of the facilities
and
you have like a supermarket like a
shopping center of parts
because the cars change about every
three hours so what parts are needed
what version of the parts what materials
changes about every three hours
which makes it a very flexible logistics
system versus traditional manufacturing
where you have the same parts
made just in time or stockpiled
but it's the same parts for several
years
tesla has more of a supermarket system
or a shopping system with many versions
and parts
well the way the logistics are moved the
robotics that move them
the software on the robots how humans
interface with the robots to load carts
um key them up into
construction packs or cartridges that go
into robots
that was many times changed in less than
20 minutes
sometimes a
a truck would be late
um or you you wouldn't know where the
truck is a supplier would lose track of
the truck uh it was
somewhere being processed by immigration
authority or or they're not even exactly
sure and it has parts you need now so
you would then
change the way the robotic funnel
pipes parts to have a possible
replacement part piped in that would be
less than 20 minutes to put that in
context most companies would change an
outbound supply process
maybe once every three years
often once every seven years
farzad working in
well all over the company but primarily
in logistics would say they had three
complete changes of all of the outbound
supply process in five months
and aspects would be changed yes within
20 minutes every day every single day
yeah so those would be examples
thank you very much jill
the next question is interesting
well then was scrum masters again coach
jobs descriptions vacancies at tesla
to my knowledge was added here
i love it
yeah i get no
hey
this is listening here
so
i found this really tricky yeah because
i'm an agile coach myself and then uh
this was an interesting insight and then
i'm wondering and thinking okay is this
something considered as basic knowledge
is the role of an agile coach worthless
or not at all there
if you can give a brief answer on that
i love it i love it you can uh eigen
again oregon eugene it's also fine
uh eugene oregon thank you thank you
very much okay um first
when i started sharing about what i was
doing as
agile at tesla
many
agile coaches with deep industry
experience
said okay i want to join and i said
great are you gonna come in for
water jet cutting are you gonna come in
for welding welding inspection and
grinding how are you gonna come in and
they say i'm gonna come in as an agile
coach
no job for you my friend
it's no job for you and they're like
what do you mean tesla is maybe the most
agile company on planet earth and spacex
and boring company and neural link and
open ai what do you mean
and
there's definitely
desire for agile skill
absolutely so there there's
that's not the problem it's not that
agile coaches don't have a a a
value right that's not it
it's that there are no single stack
people there's no single skill people in
the company
and there is no one including elon musk
that doesn't drill metal sweep floors
grind weld seams apply industrial
adhesive there's no one
and so i mean the product is the goal
an agile company is not the goal
the way to make an excellent product
includes amazing levels of agility but
you are there to make the product with
amazing levels of agility
so many companies have skills silos like
quality assurance
so mechanical engineering does their
work software engineering does their
work in skills silos and then quality
assurance says we have these
recommendations to change your practices
on the next two to five year waterfall
roadmap
um here's your kaizen initiatives and
you have these handoffs well
if you want to introduce a new product
every five years or seven years that's
fine
in tesla it's not like you could afford
the time to have agility added after the
fact by a coaches organization or a
product owner team it's just way
the speed mismatch
doesn't work at all
what you need to be doing is improving
production and helping production with
your agile skill
and the only way you're able to do it is
because you're really good at agile
right so it's that
so
inside tesla you don't even have roles
and titles really everyone's paid almost
the same
but there's roles and titles outside to
attract people with the skills they want
and if someone says
well i'm an agile transformation expert
but i don't want to write code or
program robots or load material into
robots
there is no place for you in the company
like there aren't leaders either there
aren't any it's not like elon sits in
meetings
there aren't any meetings i never saw a
single sit-down meeting or
was asked to make or saw a single
presentation the entire time i was in
the company it's just not needed because
you're just you're just working you're
at the point of work yeah so the more
interdisciplinary you are the better for
you i guess and then it's easier
yeah
i also heard that um you know like
promotions are also quite hard at tesla
because people supposed to you know get
hired for where they're best at
so yeah
just a side remark
in giga berlin
it may be becoming more different i've
been hearing different things from
previous contacts people i worked with
and then just from twitter
about the culture at giga berlin i'm not
entirely sure
it might have more roles and titles and
if so we'll see if that affects the pace
of innovation i i'm not sure
um we'll we'll see
thank you very much joe
thanks joe
uh the next question is from melanie and
i we can actually see people
voting up some of the questions which is
awesome we can see a lot of fluctuations
in the which question has the highest
votes
and by the way we're about 90 people
here which is amazing
yeah melanie melanie are you requesting
to join
hi can you hear me
yes yes oh yeah brilliant you can't see
myself from i try to switch on the
camera seemingly don't know if it works
um thanks for the last remarks on
because uh i'm an agile coach myself and
you basically just rendered my job uh
worthless
because
sometimes with i have the feeling you
know that that's absolutely fine
i think uh sometimes uh our job is um
sticking band-aids to creepy and crappy
structures and companies and that's why
we're there
so um and that that leads to the
question that i've had um
is i my assumption is that a lot of the
um the problems that we see with people
and with their burnouts and with being
virtually overloaded comes from fighting
against structures that are not helping
with actually fixing problems and that
people are really detached from being
productive and doing great stuff
that's what we sometimes try to fix
and the question because you started
with something like that saying that it
had been a place where there was some
symptoms of burning out people
is that a similar experience that you've
had or is it a different place that
you've changed from and what were the
means that you've you've taken what the
changes that you've seen that actually
made the company change into a good
place to work for
brilliant melanie now i think you
just said a far more important point
than the smaller
supporting points i'll make in a moment
i i think you
hit it
is if people are being successful
and
like delivering innovation
multiple times a day
the level of motivation fulfillment top
of maslow's hierarchy of needs
is so
good for humans humans thrive
in that environment
that
it's
far more sustainable to be
what other people would consider super
human
and it's it's truly because so much of
your energy is not spent
coping with
frustration
in a low frustration
high frequency of reward environment
rewarded by meaning achievement high
frequency of achievement environment
it is unreal
the the
achievements that humans are capable of
and and what feels normal and
sustainable that is far more important
than what i'm about to say that supports
that so
thank you for making the probably the
most important point
um the pace of innovation at tesla is
most of why it is so
fulfilling sustainable and attracts so
much top talent
because it's simply thrilling
and and relatively low frustration
nowhere is perfect but it's it's
it is a low frustration environment for
innovation supporting that
is
there are 12 hour shifts
at
tesla and all the musk companies
that means
the the benefit is you have
round-the-clock development when you
leave many people would come in an hour
early and stay an hour or more late like
i would i would typically do 15 hours
and journal and i would go downstream of
where i was likely to work that dope day
and upstream where i was likely to work
that day before and after in journal to
have a better complete picture
of the operations i'm involved in
many people would do that but at the end
of your 12 hours you hand whatever your
tool is your laptop your wrenches your
welder usually all of the above to
someone else who's just come in
you don't own anything
and when you come back
12 hours again
you get it back so you know it's
different you know there's
around-the-clock development um you know
it's not gonna stop with you it's not
your project it's the mission
so that's the good part the downside is
12 hours is really intense right so what
tesla does now
is you work three days a week you work
three 12-hour days and then you have
four days off to go camping
learn to play the piano go swimming
be a full-time parent be a a wonderful
present spouse whatever
the next week you have four days working
and three days off
and it alternates four three four three
four three now you can choose to work
more than your four or three days elon
works every day
but there is zero shame
there there is only support
encouragement i experienced tesla to be
a very loving environment
for working three days a week and then
four days then the next week
that's important
the next is
elon likes fun
if you follow elon on twitter which is
an easy way to get
acquainted with elon's personality elon
likes memes
and funny things elon was um
uh
host of saturday night live an american
comedy show and i think elon did a great
job i think was hilarious actually i i
thought um that's part of elon
so there's fun and funny things all
around the the facilities and it it
simply makes it
it really changes the environment and
the feeling
the the mission is focusing
but it's in a very playful way there's a
lot of dance music
um starship the largest rocket ever was
stacked
and when it was first stacked so it
became the tallest rocket ever in the
history of humans it's just
huge
on massive loudspeakers they played a
nicki minaj song that you could hear
like two towns away like that's how loud
this was
and the the song was starships
and and the refrain is starships are
made to fly and nicki minaj who's whose
stage name is written after making love
to three people at once it's a play on
menage a trois so like this is a really
uncouth
song you know quite rude actually and
the refrain is higher than a mother
and they're blasting this so you can
hear it two towns away and its starships
are made to fly it's the pounding tick
that's the way spacex does stuff and
they have a bar a tiki bar like with
with these but with my ties in them
at the top of the launch tower
like that's that was a critical part
of making this launch tower for the
largest rocket is this bar at the top so
it's very playful
and that helps so part of what i'm
focusing on now
is with what i'm calling
joe's agile hardware you know like the
the kind easy version of the musk model
is the gamification piece to make it
actually feel like you're you're playing
a game which the musk companies already
do i'm trying to amplify that because it
seems to work
super cool answer thank you jill
thanks no honey and we had a lot of
parties in the parking lot virtually uh
in your agile hardware class
next question is from robot
um what would you mind hopping on the
stage
so we can hear and hopefully see you
another video here should be on can you
hear me okay
ah there's another i need to enable the
video separately
um
we are just in the middle of our agile
journey turning the whole company to
agile and
still
we did not yet
agree on how to do this with the
hardware so we are producing little
electronic uh mechanical devices heat
cost allocators water meters stuff like
that gateways
so um
what to your understanding would be
the main difference for the hardware
guys when moving to agile hardware
development compared to the traditional
stuff where you start collecting
requirements and then plan the project
and
go through all the different stages of
the product lifecycle
wow wow um
when we're starting any transformation
it was the same for software if we think
about software in like 1979
right um with the extreme manufacturing
start extreme programming practices
being popularized in the 80s the early
80s so you have like
paper
and the cost to compile to turn like
handwritten notes of code to turn that
into byte code or even punch cards
was a huge endeavor that took months and
people would like check by hand
stacks of punch cards
and notes of the logic the paper written
logic does that match the punch cards
the compile step getting it into byte
code was often months especially for a
significant piece of software so you
naturally had a waterfall where you
would draw freehand what this thing
might do you tried to write pseudocode
there was no autocomplete
the ides were very i mean you didn't
have an ide your ide was a notebook
right like a paper notebook
and you'd cross things out different
colors you'd have meetings to analyze
the logic and then you do compile
and teams of humans would would
sort through the logic and try to get it
closer to bytecode
well what enabled extreme programming
was fast compile
where in less than 10 minutes
you would get feedback on does it
compile at all and eventually where did
it fail and eventually autocomplete
until now when you're writing software
many times the the
variable names autocomplete the function
names autocomplete and it's extremely
different experience than developing in
1979
well
most companies have not invested yet
in that level of
digital support
for hardware
so if someone's doing a circuit board
layout
there there are tools that help them but
it does not auto complete the same way
writing c sharp does
not by a long shot and it doesn't auto
comp it doesn't auto compile flow
through with logic testing continuity
testing at the same level as a modern
software ide
and still to compile
from a circuit board layout in software
to a physical circuit board is still
often a three week or longer process
through vendors
none of this has to be true
so the the steps
really are to reduce the cycle time the
compile time
so getting a physical circuit board for
example that matches your cad and then
improving the digital support tools
of the development environment and
putting them together
i mean the fact that you compile on your
machine or virtually to the point where
it feels on your machine is important
and the fact that it's fast less than 10
minutes now you know seconds often for
your branch or however you're doing it
the goal is to do that in hardware
so there is this
company-wide ambition
to increase the
quality of the digital development tools
in cad
in layouting in virtual test in
automated test
script those so they're running
constantly
so if you're drawing a car door
as you're drawing it you have red light
green light or heat map impact testing
results as you're drawing it not as an
after effect in a different department
it is as you're drawing
it's
is this more green than the last door or
not
so there's no time spent at the design
time getting validation that is
a goal of digital self-management your
self-managing is this superior
then compile time
ideally
next to you
is a machine
that's milling
usually out of a block of aluminum but
there's a lot of ways to do it
the the stamped die set for that car
door
so 45 minutes from now a sheet of
aluminum or steel or whatever goes
between the die and it makes one of
those doors
you know it has to go through several to
get the different
chamfers and angles but you have
feedback in less than an hour that is
perfectly possible for a door
now most companies will make a new die
set once every five to seven years
so you have a five to seven year compile
time
well you got a lot of times you might as
well do it in a waterfall with skill
silos
that's a broken mind in investment
why don't we have our own milling
machine to make die sets yes that's
expensive it's a few million euro but
how much does it cost you to have that
supplier and what's the cost of delay
to not have that part sooner so in a
tesla company there's a musk company
there's no question of course we're
going to have our own machine
and it's going to be within three meters
of whoever's drawing that part so you
see the current doors being stamped and
you see the current die set
as you draw the next door you are right
there you're definitely not in an office
two countries away
and
your the idea is to then shorten that
compile time
because you cannot be more agile than
your compile time so if your current
procedure
that you're not allowed to change
currently is i'm going to send this
cad model off to a supplier
they will get back to me in three months
will then respond to their counters
and then they'll get back to me in
another three months and net 18 months
from now will have the part
that's your sprint that's your iteration
it's 18 months
so your goal then is shortening that and
something magical happens when it gets
less than a year
now you can do quarterly budgeting
instead of annual budgeting and that's
what scaled agile framework is actually
very good at doing is taking something
to be less than a year
and then once you get near a month
that's what scrum is really good at
doing can we get it less than a month
because now having
self-organizing cross-functional agile
teams with a product owner and a scrum
master makes sense when you're trying to
get just less than a month like moving
from a quarter of a year
to less than a month
now once you get under a month scrum is
just too slow there's too many meetings
i mean you'd be spending all your time
meetings not doing the work and that's
where you get to what the musk model is
this real-time self-organization you get
much closer to silicon valley agile when
it's when it's high quality
um
and you don't have a product owner or
scrum master or events anymore because
they're just not quick enough to keep up
with that pace
so that's i think how frameworks map all
based on speed of the iteration so the
goal is really engineering practices
that reduce compile time and engineering
practices that increase digital
self-management um that's what i call
extreme manufacturing
um that's what katrin now has been
immersed in
um and that's what my course is about
um but but it it's
it's it's that
thanks for your answer very insightful
appreciate that
robert i noticed i took several minutes
to say that and it didn't need to take
several minutes what i would love is if
anyone views the recording especially
you and tries to make what i just said a
tweet like because it could be the
actual value i said was you know
20 words if someone can find that
and say it better than i said it i'd be
really grateful
it's a perfect transition to the next
question in your class we also talked
about uh autonomous testing and that
every single car goes to the testing
line and we actually have a question on
test
from
oregon i'm sorry
don't worry
i guess you uh already answered this
question by the previous one
because you talked about about
shorting the compiling time and doing
tests so i would skip this because the
next question is also from me
[Laughter]
and i kind of feel like the guys in the
lineup already
probably angry with me yeah so the
question goes like this i'm currently
i'm
way into um looking sanji sanji's tear
down of the model plate s
and while looking at the back part of
the car the motors they said okay this
looks like really like a symphony of
engineering
and
this is like an interdisciplinary team
is doing this
and you can imagine like by just looking
at this how hard this is and how much
dependencies are there and my question
is
how the heck are they managing those
dependencies across all the different
teams
how is this possible i hope your
nga still allows you to tell us a little
bit more about this
yeah
easy
and i think you'll laugh i think ageless
will be like oh of course um
first here's a picture of the automated
testing so this is uh every car as soon
as they're assembled puts themselves
through every homologation test this is
critical
if you homologate a new model every
five years
that means you can't introduce new
significantly new product faster than
you test right so test is the bottleneck
homologation road legalization is the
bottleneck for bmw daimler volkswagen
ford toyota mitsubishi honda
so what tesla does is they automate that
it's called factory mode and every car
puts itself through all required
homologation and road legal testing
and every car then has a one-page
digital document saying here's what's
different from the last car potentially
and that goes out for certification for
just that car
so each car is individually certified as
road legal
what that means is you can introduce any
change anytime
because you have gated check-in for
quality each product is tested where if
you test one out of every 10 000 cars
you can't make change between those 10
000 cars you're restricted so this is
what factory mode is this is where
autopilot came from if you think of how
huge the software hardware supplier
investment is in autopilot
that was actually all for autonomous
testing or hardware devops that was it
that was the only purpose
later
someone in tesla said actually i think
we could at least have some level of
lane keeping assist for our end users
because we have all this technology
already
autopilot was a side effect and it's now
thought to be the largest profit
increase
of the tesla product line of any any
feature but that was not its original
intention its original intention was
just autonomous testing that's how
important it is of course spacex does
the same thing the rockets autonomously
test themselves the sprint reviews are
really exciting as a result
and long-running tests oh i don't have
the graphic here
long-running tests are done in farms
of
huge
fields
of
parallel testing and new parts are added
multiple times a day to to the bank of
long-running parts
the goal is to approve materials and
shapes and not products
so if you say i'm making a new rocket
combustion chamber
well it's new but you don't want to wait
months for different types of tests
instead you say has the material i used
in the shape i used been validated
already
and you have this library of validated
shapes and materials
well that means you don't ever have to
wait on a long running test
or rarely
because you have this ever-growing
library and there's no test phase it
never ends there's always new parts
ending entering the test farms the test
farms are always growing parts that have
not yet destructed are still in there
forever until they destruct so you have
never ending test and it's automated in
the cloud and by what's called dojo and
in the cloud full time also to do
accelerated um
virtual
long running tests as well so that's
about the test piece so you can see it
then
to
your point on the symphony of cross
functionality
well remember it's agendas right there
is no mechanical engineering team or
like engine cradle team there there
isn't one
why would you do that
for an agilist perspective it it's
actually
truly stupid to organize any other way
um and agilis i think get this
intuitively so you have a goal it's
let's make a really compact
engine drivetrain package so that's an
agenda item
okay what do we need to know to do that
well what's the
outer maximum outer dimensions of the
motor and how it connects and the motor
can continue to iterate but as long as
we accommodate the maximum outer
dimension
then it can continue to change we're not
restricting its development
um okay how about the cooling systems
how much of those need to be on board
which can be or which can be remote
efficiently and you have
the law of two feet
saying anyone can go to this package
group this package agenda item so of
course someone who's working on the
motor who recently did is going to be
excited to join i want to see it
packaged i want to be part of that
and there's no mandate it's like musk
taps someone on the shoulder and it's
like i need you to go join the packaging
team
there's there's just this agenda on your
phone and on these big monitors and it
attracts people who can add value
because you're encouraged to use the law
of two feet
and because there's no ladder to climb
or again you referenced this earlier
like there's there's just not really
promotion your income is stock price
like there's no next position to get
there's then very little
incentive for you to say you have to
pick my idea or i need to own it because
there's there's no promotion
there's just stock price so you're like
i just want to make great cars and
so so
it's really easy to say actually that's
a better idea
it's it's it's easy in fact it happens
multiple times a day so of course you
have a cross-functional team and it's
not even product based and it's not
coordination across departments there
aren't really departments
to an agilist this actually just makes
clear easy sense
well
yeah thanks also for sharing those
insights it's like
it really feels fresh to hear
so much thought and
innovation how you can organize people
or really how people choose to organize
themselves maybe maybe a follow-up since
this is my third question um
why did you left tesla and my second
point would be why did you really left
tesla oh yeah yeah okay
well so the why i left and then the the
real answer um let's start with the real
answer
is um
i had about a million dollars of tesla
stock
actually just over a million dollars of
tesla stock
and my own ethics
said
i don't want to be biased by my money
when i enter this company
um i believe in the company that's why
i'm joining i actually
at that time and still now i think the
stock is going to absolutely appreciate
holding it is the smartest thing i could
do
but my ethics said i don't want to be
blinded by my cash
i want to go in and see the company if i
can for what it is
so i sold 100 of my stock
just before i accepted the employment
contract
like the the day the day i signed it i
sold all my shares waited until the sale
went through and then signed yes i
joined the company
um
reuters had been publishing a hundred
percent negative
uh
news articles on tesla for several years
continuously
and i knew
the tesla product was much better than
what reuters chose to say
but reuters had a financial advantage
for publishing 100
negative reviews not covering any of the
positive reviews
um
or or positive engineering advancements
and reuters is picked up
as incoming materials by many other
outlets and other outlets did the same
but reuters did at a very high level and
they're picked up by other feeds and
then rewritten for to look like other
companies news outlets
so i knew at some point reuters would
decide to buy into tesla stock and
change their narrative to be positive
and that would be an early indicator
that
the stock price was about to
not only readjust but then jump
artificially passed
well as soon as i joined tesla i was in
a 30-day blackout period can't buy or
sell stock the day after i sold my
shares and joined the company reuters
published their first positive review of
tesla
and so i said oh it's coming it's coming
like later today the stock price is
going to surge and i really thought to
myself no one's going to notice if i buy
back in
i'm not going to be audited i'm just
some person
in fact it's not like i had a tesla
stock account this was my own stock
account it's not even directly linked
it'd be difficult to even trace no one's
going to care no one's going to notice
joe you should buy back in
i kept to my ethics i didn't buy back in
for 30 days
the tesla 5x stock place price split
happened while i was in the
blackout period and that i chose not to
engage so i would have made 5 million
i would have had 1 million go to 5
million and eventually it actually
continued to grow so it would have gone
more
i waited until my 30-day blackout period
ended and i bought back in and i still
made like half a million dollars
but it wasn't um
set for life
i mean in aggregate had i never sold and
i do think about this all the time and
no one would have noticed um i would
have made now about eight million
uh
including the initial one million so i
would have made in addition about seven
million i i did do fine i mean
i did great
but i i missed this huge event
what that taught me
is
i can sweat inside the company if i love
it
but it's my job to take care of me
it's
my job to finance myself it's not like
musk is looking to say oh you made a
really bad financial decision here let
me help you
that's not the way the companies run
it's it's my job to have
to sustain my family myself
and
i could do that with even less
restriction outside the company than
inside
i could directly influence inside the
company the financial opportunities are
actually a little easier outside the
company than inside because there's no
blackouts
so in many ways that's what
gave me logical permission to leave as i
said financially this
it actually makes as good if not better
sense i i now am even more convinced
that
given a 10-year time span which averages
out media manipulation of the stock
price it will only rock it up
so if i just hold my million investment
i can then do whatever i want so i left
the company i bought a condo in hawaii i
moved to hawaii and life has been
awesome
so that that worked out
now then also the reason i left tesla at
the time i did
so we have one what logically justified
it and then also why i left at the time
i did is my son was turning four
and
i
said to all the people around me i want
to take several days off to
go camping with my son for his fourth
birthday
and
there's scheduling according to
california labor labor law like tesla
doesn't need this but california law
does and so tesla needs to be compliant
because i was in fremont california at
the mother ship we call that big factory
and
according to the the loading schedules
for for california law
i had to be there
and i talked to my team i made sure that
teams uh made sure they had what they
needed
and i said
okay that's why i'm doing it on this day
i'm going to go
with
be with my son and every human there
that interactive was like of course
but according to labor loading um i
either needed to
have a
have
three or four days of not show up when
scheduled which i i wanted a perfect
record um
or resign and i said okay
wow yeah thanks for sharing also the
brave move with the stock
thank you thank you i mean that was a
kick in the in the sternum because like
no one i i okay not no one few people
had more conviction in the value of the
stock than me
so like if the universe were only just
and fair the the universe would have
been like joe you joined the company
because you believe in it it's okay
but um and also if i had less rigorous
ethics and had bought back in or not
sold i like i've yeah so i also realized
humans like to make fairness it's good
if you ask like three-year-olds is it
fair that dolphins get sick because of
chemicals people pour in the ocean
they're like no that's not fair like
humans get it right we understand it's
an intuitive thing but that doesn't mean
nature's that way
so that also was a good real life lesson
of nature is not fair
nature is nature so
please do your best to have 80
confidence of your ability to continue
your family
thanks for opening sharing uh jill
if you okay we would um read two more
questions would that be okay for you
so the next one is from florian
how do you realize the fast feedback for
any suggestion made
florian would you would you like to join
it's coming up
yeah i've tried
to so hi joe
um
yes so um
you're at this point with anyone in the
company can bring in suggestions and
they are quickly evaluated
i got a bit of an idea now from the
other answers um
but still can you elaborate a bit about
it
totally totally florian the
the dream
is that from the moment you do something
you enact some change you change the
shape of the door in cad or you change
the metal that's going to go on the
inner pillar of the door in cad or you
change the way a paint robot does one of
the passes or you make a change to the
chemical mix of the powders that go into
the paints whatever you the goal is as
soon as you make a change you would
immediately know was it better or worse
that's the dream right so that's the
core principle
then
one way to do that is you have a master
crafts person
next to you
and they say based on my decades of deep
passion and experience
i think you did a good job
good job
and that works that actually works and
they're not always 100 right because
sometimes you're doing something truly
new and they don't know either
but
at least it's reassuring to know they
also don't know you're you know in a
totally new territory so that's one way
interestingly
most of what human sense comes from
their eyes
now there's there's a significant amount
that comes from sound for example to
test composites do you avoid area where
epoxy didn't penetrate the woven
uh
structure at different layers of the
composite you actually use a piece of
metal often a coin and you tap along the
composite and you get a very different
sound when there's a void area
so that's also sense coming in some
things you can touch heat conductivity
is different depending on the quality of
a weld underneath some things you need
to x-ray and then use your eyes to look
at the x-ray
well the cool thing about machine
learning
is now at least tesla's flavor of
machine learning is really good at auto
tagging
auto tagging things humans can see
especially visual but some audio and
if it can be made visual like audio
waves
or like heat propagation can be made
visual through heat maps it's really
good at auto tagging and machine
learning if you give it enough compute
power is essentially instant
so
what tesla does the goal is you quickly
know was it good or not good right
that's the goal
many of these machine learning has
digitized what the master crafts person
would have assessed
because they're using their eyes and
seeing does the light reflect
differently here or they're listening
and having to paint the metal or they're
feeling does the heat propagate
sometimes all of the above
well all of those machine learning is
now really good at doing
what machine learning is not great at
doing is saying and now you should be
this i mean it can generate a cloud of a
thousand possible variants and do some
automated testing but it's humans are
still way better at creative problem
solving
what machine learning can't do instantly
is say
to the level of a master crafts person
you just made an improvement
good job
so what you do you get these like
virtual pats on the back
and what tesla is bad at
is actually having someone pat you on
the back no one does that or
so really you're celebrating just with
whoever's there you're like we did this
and then immediately the next challenge
is there right so i mean
there's an opportunity to celebrate
better elon tries to amplify this but
really the culture is
solved the next challenge now i mean
immediately right so there could be more
celebration that's an opportunity but
how that happens is largely by machine
learning stacks
doing human level assessment
you know like robotic probes and their
goal is to in less than five seconds and
often many times in milliseconds because
if it's pure vision it can go almost
instantly
give you feedback did is the change
you're trying to make now better or
worse
[Laughter]
thanks for the question florian
thank you
very interesting
our last question is from melanie who
we've seen before how do you measure
individual or team contribution
efficiency how do you assess who spend
the money wisest
genius and by the way melanie if i'm
remembering you correctly you have a
beautiful scarf today i
i i think you did a great job on how you
tied it
that's actually something i've been
trying in my free time lately it's how
are these beautiful scarf shapes tied
man that is an art there's truly
hundreds of ways they all look
completely different and i appreciate
what you did today
um melanie if you want to talk to us
just stood on mute
you can unmute at the bottom
of the screen
please melanie
yes i think i figured it out ah yes oh a
different melanie sorry different
melanie sewing was that melanie at all
someone else had a lovely scarf but
pleased to talk to you melanie it's just
a jumper so um no no craftsmanship in
that
but thank you for the flowers
appreciate that yeah the the what sprung
to mind is that um usually in in the old
economy that i'm for example working for
much of the control comes from setting
up the right kpis and there's a tendency
of having sort of a pseudo control with
stuff that can't be measured so the the
the question maybe is a bit two-fold on
one side what are the limitations for
that is the stuff that you could
actually cannot measure throughput
through an engine assembly speed that
something can easily measure and um
is that the solely um sort of of kpi
that you take for making those decisions
which teams improve most and um yeah can
you can you elaborate on that a bit more
awesome awesome um
i did not see
an agenda item that didn't have at least
a measure
um it doesn't mean it was awesome
right because when you start you propose
some measure and it might actually be
quite clumsy or a poor fit but it's
something
oh now that's crowdsourced anyone can
propose a superior measure and if it's
voted by simple majority of whoever
votes it's auto-replaced
right so you don't have to convince
anyone other than you propose it and if
the fit looks better it's automatically
replaced
but that doesn't mean everything has an
appropriate measure
right but there's a measure and we're
trying
[Music]
then you have fit to mission
and
for example uh it's been said and i
believe it's true if anyone proposed
anything
that brought
a musk company
closer to having a mars base
it would be approved immediately period
no matter what
it's on mission
and if anything anyone proposed anything
that was not on path to that
it would have no chance it'd be
immediately called immediately killed
and that completely resonates with my
experience so there's also a mission fit
that said the mission is human
understandable enough
like no one at this point is saying what
the mars base has to look like and is it
primarily a hydrogen economy or no one's
making those specifics
so that means you have this generalized
vision of a self-sustaining
colony on mars to the point of spreading
consciousness amount among the stars
it's wide enough that
just about everyone has some idea of
what that could mean and they
self-assess constantly is what i'm doing
in line
and humans
self-manage a lot of this um
to that end because the vision is is
actually really well understood
um at every level well there aren't
really levels but i mean no matter who
got hired in is is what i'm saying
now many companies have a high cost to
make change
because their suppliers are primarily
18-month lead time
and even the design is outsourced and
then the production is outsourced and
then testing is outsourced so they have
an outsourced multi-step waterfall your
maximum slow structure and that's normal
because in a spreadsheet it looks
inexpensive
except we measure cost of delay then
it's extremely
it's it's then a very poor choice when
cost of delay is um
is counted in the formula but if you're
doing spreadsheet accounting and cogs
only this screw is
two cents less if we buy it from here
even though they have an 18 month lead
time but it's two cents more if we buy
it from someone here in cologne
well buy it over there the cost of delay
is not accounted for when you're just
looking at individual cost parts
okay
so
when you have a high cost to change
when you have
a multi-year ripple effect
then you have every incentive to have a
kpi
that protects you from making changes
because it will disrupt your waterfall
and you have a high cost of change
if you have a low cost of change you're
buying your screws here in cologne so
you could buy a different screw tomorrow
there is
no penalty to switching screws
you will get it tomorrow or actually if
we wanted we could go get it in 45
minutes if we really wanted but our
regular supply comes tomorrow at 7 00 am
so
very little cost to make change
then you there's so much less stress on
having an idealized kpi to protect you
from the cost of change
and that is fundamentally
the
the paradigm shift
um now
musk also wants this to be self-managed
so musk has said it by now quite
eloquently you know after several years
of trying to say it now musk has a short
way of saying it
pace of innovation is the only thing
that matters in the long run
that mindset
makes us all think in terms of how to
increase the pace of innovation and it
has nothing to do with cost optimization
of us screw
it and musk has been saying this since
the beginning it's a very agile thought
process but musk took many words and it
was clumsy now it's quite concise pace
of innovation is the only thing that
matters in the long run
then to support that
musk will say how you measure that
now must conside
quite
neatly
how you measure that is how much
innovation is there per iteration
and how short is your iteration
well that's super agile
it is an agile company and that is the
the managing metric
so now you have a consistent wish to
shorten the iteration and increase the
innovation which an innovation is change
that blows up the idea of a change
control process the last thing you want
is to slow down change
um and so there is no change control
process there's no change review board
nothing instead you have automated test
so you know if the change you made was
good and if so it's in production now
and since every car is tested
individually for legal certification
that car sold
today
um so you have this
this system
now for for a lot of us as agile coaches
agile passionate people
what do we do
we're at one piece in this system
right
and
we're not in control of the overall
like there's still a budget and
we're not the majority vote of how the
budget is allocated and you say what do
we do
well we all have a sphere of influence
whether it's just us
or it's a group of three people or it's
um a budget line of three million euro a
year whatever our sphere of influence we
all have a sphere of influence in that
sphere of influence if we start making
decisions as pace of innovation is the
only thing that matters in the long run
that then brings us to the extreme
manufacturing practices and joe's agile
hardware
now it all fits right so in your sphere
of influence you can do it
now what you can't do is do it in
someone else's sphere of influence so
you're bottlenecked before and after you
and you can't it's not your sphere of
influence so then the next step is to
try to increase your sphere of influence
and that's where things like this meetup
come in which is why i'm so passionately
interested in being here um and that's
where you do internal keynotes brown
bags um hand people my book i i think
it's actually a a poorly written but
excellent book um so
and
hand that around
i'll be honest
as a first-time author it's quite clumsy
but the context content i think is
actually excellent um
or play this recording for people who
are interested or a three-minute excerpt
that you think is good and that starts
to you find like-minded people and you
self-organize on a larger sphere of
influence bam bam bam bam
now something magical happens when your
sphere of influence does include the
budget
because then you can
if you choose to you could dissolve the
budget and use silicon valley accounting
which then there's no penalty to change
financially you're only incented for
faster change
so there is a magic tipping point where
you cross the chasm and that's when you
have people thinking this way this level
of agility
who are paying people
uh large groups of people and setting
the financial cadence that is a tipping
point so it is frustrating until we get
there of course but at least in terms of
our sphere of influence we can we can do
a hundred percent of this in our sphere
it just won't have that dramatic awesome
effect until we encompass
the budget allocation and therefore
company policy
yeah very true we're a couple miles away
we're actually um doing something like
that so we managed to decouple a small
part of the organization from the rest
of the budgeting and now we have it in
our hands we can control that we could
actually do that and i absolutely have
to steal that storytelling that image of
reducing compile time because that so
well explains what we're trying to
achieve just reduce the compile time
that's brilliant
thank you so much joe
uh we will go over to the networking
session now
first of all thank you so much it was um
such a great session with you today
um thanks for taking your time
very valuable input from you we already
received amazing feedback on twitter and
other uh platforms
i'd like to thank christian and katrin
and i'd like to invite everyone um i'm
interested now on
abi
agile.com i'm attempting that to be a
platform that many people are on right
now i'm a trainer on that platform i
have these courses and i
join boards of advisors i want it to be
more than me i do have some partners i'd
like a lot more
for example there's a very talented
person i was just talking with yesterday
about teaching a one hour agile hardware
course that's compatible with the way
musk does things and the way i'm trying
to do things so
actually fast
pace of innovation
for people who want to go deeper in
agile architecture and i'm intending
right now to put them
fully promoted and so you can enroll in
their online one-hour agile architecture
session on
dot agilebusinessinstitute.com
abi-agile.com
what i'd wish is for everyone here to
think
what's something that you think is a
little bit better than an average
company maybe even way better
towards where we're going
because it's in steps right i i do think
scaled agile framework is awesome for
companies that aren't yet delivering in
less than a year and i do think scrum is
awesome for companies that are not yet
delivering in less than a month
i if you introduced scaled agile or
scrum into tesla it'd be rejected
immediately it's too slow but that
doesn't mean they don't have a great
place in in my understanding of how this
should work
so if you're a less practitioner if
you're a management 3.0 practitioner
like jurgen ditmar i've taken jurgen's
course and i was actually really
impressed with what dr ditmar did
or you're going to pillow the author if
you do
disciplined agile delivery
if you do your own flavor
if you do human factors and it's a point
in the progression
and as long as you're okay with the
destination that i'm trying to go
then let's do it i'd like to make this a
platform so please do contact me
preferably on twitter so everyone can
see our interaction but if you need to
be private because you're still part of
a client and you don't yet get to
discuss publicly you could email me joe
at abi
and we can start that conversation of
us promoting
your work as part of this
continuum
i mean eventually i hope we're thousands
of people on there with multiple courses
being run
around the clock and right now i do
europe time zone courses europe and
africa
north and south america slice and asia
slice and i do
one week
a month changing my sleep schedule
sometimes i do more than one a day and
sleep four hours because i i'm driven
um
i i hope there's people that like to
engage in a given time zone or more
maybe it's your evening and someone
else's morning and and we we become
i i hope a global force for positive
change again my goal is for everyone to
have their own company so eight billion
companies maybe you're one of them and
we're partners
and
um they're innovating as fast as the
musk companies
so to people who feel trapped in an
existing company
my wish is you start your own company
now we can't all consult to other
companies or we'd have 8 billion people
helping
nobody
someone actually has to make stuff
so i will encourage some people to make
things
hopefully valuable things and if these
methods actually work you'll be able to
innovate really quickly
so that's the ultimate test please
please make some things uh and and and
let's do it
thank you so much agile hardware meetup
germany and and the global attendance
group
you
